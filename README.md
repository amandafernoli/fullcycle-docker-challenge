# Full Cycle Docker Challenge
Full Cycle course challenge to learn docker


## First challenge

This challenge was proposed by the Full Cycle course to build a Go image with less than 2 MB. This image only contains a print command in the console. When you run the container, `Full Cycle Rocks!!` should appear.

To download and run the image, use the command: 

```shell 
docker run amandafrnoli/fullcycle
```
